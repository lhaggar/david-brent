I don't look upon this like it's the end, I look upon it like it's moving on you know. It's almost like my work here's done. I can't imagine Jesus going 'Oh, I've told a few people in Bethlehem I'm the son of God, can I just stay here with Mum and Dad now?' No. You gotta move on. You gotta spread the word. You gotta go to Nazareth, please. And that's, very much like... me.

My world does not end within these four walls, Slough's a big place. And when I've finished with Slough, there's Reading, Aldershot, Bracknell, you know I've got to-Didcott, Yately. You know. My-Winersh, Taplow. Because I am my own boss, I can-Burfield, GitHub, npm.

const davidBrent = require('david-brent');

const randomQuote = davidBrent();
console.log(randomQuote); //Go and get the guitar.

const musing = davidBrent.mused(`this is the module I've needed!`);
console.log(musing); //Brent mused, and then replied; this is the module I've needed!

const quip = davidBrent.quipped(`this just gets better and better!`);
console.log(quip); //David quipped; this just gets better and better!
```
